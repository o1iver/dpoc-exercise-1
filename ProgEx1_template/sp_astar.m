% Function for solving shortest path problem using the A*
% Algorithm.  For selecting the nodes from the candidate list OPEN, use
% depth-first method.
% Solution according to Bertsekas Sec. 2.3.2.
%
% Input:
%   P           Cost matrix P where the element p_ij, is the
%               cost to move from node i to node j
%   startNode   start node of the desired shortest path, can have values
%               from 1 to M
%   termNode    terminal node of the desired shortest path, can have values
%               from 1 to M
%	m,n			Dimension of the original terrain matrix T (you will need this for the heuristic)
%
% Output:
%   optCost     Cost of the shortest path(s), scalar.
%   optPath     Row vector holding the nodes that correspond to a shortest 
%               path, i.e. a path that has the optimal cost optCost.
%               For example, optPath = [88 55 33 1 76] corresponds to the 
%               shortest path 88->55->33->1->76, where 88 is the starting
%               and 76 is the terminal node.
