function P=generateCostMat(T,b,costFunc)
% P=generateCostMat(T,b)
% 
% Function to create the cost matrix P that is required by the algorithms from the terrain matrix T
%
% Input:
%   T   		terrain matrix T that contains the height of the grid cells of the terrain
%   b    		lower bound on the cost function, i.e. 0 for part I and 1 for part II
%
% Output:
%   P           Cost matrix P where the element p_ij, is the
%               cost to move from node i to node j
